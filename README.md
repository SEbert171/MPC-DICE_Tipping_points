# MPC-DICE_Tipping_points
The MPC-DICE_Tipping_points code for the Bachelor Thesis by Simon Ebert

Implementation of 3 tipping points in the native Matlab-implementation of Nordhaus' DICE-model with a receding time horizon MPC-DICE. The original code can
be found under https://github.com/cmkellett/MPC-DICE. The general working of the original code remains the same, however, there have been made several
adjustments in the different functions to facilitate the proper working of the model. The model uses CasADi, which is also uploaded to the present repository,
so that no further installations have to be made to run the tipping points DICE-model. The CasADi-code is available under https://github.com/casadi/casadi
and has not been modified at all.
